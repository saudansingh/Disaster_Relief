  **Disaster Damage Resource Prediction**
  
   
   **Project Overview**
   
   The Disaster Damage Resource Prediction project leverages AI and machine learning to predict the extent of damage and the necessary resources required for disaster relief. By analyzing 
    historical disaster data and utilizing advanced predictive techniques, this system aims to provide timely and accurate resource allocation recommendations.

**Features**

1. Predicts disaster damage based on historical data.

 2. Analyzes resource needs for effective disaster response.
 
3. Uses machine learning models for accurate predictions.

 4. Provides visual insights through data visualizations.

 **Dataset**
 
 The project utilizes a dataset consisting of historical disaster reports, including information on:

* Type of disaster (earthquake, flood, fire, etc.)

* Damage severity levels

* Required resources (medical aid, food, shelter, etc.)

* Geographic location

**Technologies Used**

* Python for data processing and model training

* Machine Learning (Regression, Decision Trees, or Deep Learning)

* Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation

* Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

* Jupyter Notebook for experimentation

**Model Implementation**

  The predictive model is trained using:

* Feature selection techniques to improve accuracy

* Correlation analysis for understanding dependencies

* Regression models to forecast resource requirements

**How to Run**

  * Clone this repository

  git clone https://github.com/your-repo/disaster-prediction.git
  
  cd disaster-prediction

  * Install dependencies
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
  * Run the Jupyter Notebook

    jupyter notebook Disaster.ipynb

 **Results & Interpretations**


The model provides insights into:

   * Predicted severity of upcoming disasters
     
  * Estimated resources needed for relief efforts
    
  * Accuracy and performance metrics
